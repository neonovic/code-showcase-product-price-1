This is a code written for a simple job proposition.
The task was something like: "You have a product with price - and you will want to display it in a different exchage rates, with different formatting output."

Nowaday, when I think about it... It is hard not to go "large, complicated" code architecture, when one wants to showcase his skills.
But in the real scenario - there should be many questions about the real needs, right now.
Because I like YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it) principless, KISS (Keep it stupid simple). 
My code is not YAGNI - my code expects complexity of my anticipated scenario.
