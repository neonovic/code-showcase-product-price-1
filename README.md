This is a code written for a simple job proposition.
The task was something like: "You have a product with price - and you will want to display it in a different exchage rates, with different formatting output."

Nowaday, when I think about it... It is hard not to go "larger" scale in architecture, when one wants to showcase his skills.
But in the end - there would be so many questions, continuous steps leading to the real-time architecture.
I like YAGNI principless, KISS. 
My code is not YAGNI - my code expects complexity of my envisioned proportions.

Anyway - it was just a simple task, to show how I think around the code :)
